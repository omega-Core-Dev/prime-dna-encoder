# Prime DNA Encoding (Experimental)

This project explores a mathematical encoding mechanism based on prime number factorization.

Each character is mapped to a unique prime number.
The encoded output is generated using structured exponentiation across prime positional bases.

## Concept

The algorithm:

1. Maps characters to unique prime identifiers (DNA layer).
2. Applies positional prime exponentiation.
3. Generates a large integer structure.
4. Serializes the result using Base64.

The decoding process relies on prime factor decomposition.

## Purpose

This is an experimental mathematical encoding system designed for:

- Studying prime factor structures
- Exploring deterministic encoding mechanisms
- Architectural experimentation

⚠️ This project is NOT intended to replace modern cryptographic standards.
It has not been audited and should not be used for sensitive data protection.

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Status

Research / Experimental.
